<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Ember is an incomplete project consisting of four basic components, and several ancillary components. The components of the main project are:
    <ul>
        <li>A <b>specification</b> of principles and methods on which the project is based (completion: <span class="project-completion-begun">begun</span>)</li>
    	<li>A <b>community</b> and a non-profit <b>organization</b> to manage and implement the project (completion: <span class="project-completion-none">none</span>)</li>
    	<li>A <b>computing environment</b> (completion: <span class="project-completion-begun">begun</span>)</li>
    	<li>A <b>library</b> of knowledge and great cultural works (completion: <span class="project-completion-moderate">moderate</span>)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>This set of Web pages is the specification mentioned above (including specifications for the other three components of the project).</p>

<h2>Ancillary components</h2>
<p>The main project is not yet functioning in a manner such that it can be used, but some ancillary projects — mostly software — are stable and usable; stable and usable projects are labeled ". Ancillary components:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A spiritual framework</li>
    <li>A <b>multimedia artwork</b></li>
</ul>
