<h2>Core project</h2>
<span class="big-annotation">(work-in-progress; see <a href="#ready">below</a> for ready-to-use things)</span>
<p>Ember is an incomplete project consisting of four basic components, and several ancillary components. The components of the main project are:
    <ul class="small-text close-up-top">
        <li class="project-completion-begun">A <a href="specification/" class="important-word">specification</a> of principles and methods on which the project is based: <span>begun</span></li>
    	<li class="project-completion-not-started">A <a href="community/" class="important-word">community</a> and a non-profit <span class="important-word">organization</span> to manage and implement the project: <span>not started</span></li>
    	<li class="project-completion-begun">A <a href="computing/" class="important-word">computing environment</a>: <span>begun</span></li>
    	<li class="project-completion-partly-complete">The <a href="library/" class="important-word">Ember Heritage Library</a>, a <span class="important-word">library</span> of knowledge and great cultural works: <span>partly complete</span></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>This set of Web pages is the specification mentioned above (including specifications for the other three components of the project).</p>

<h2 id="ready">Ready-to-use tools and resources</h2>
<p>These are secondary projects that are related to the development of the main project. The main project is not yet functioning in a manner such that it can be used, but these ancillary projects are generally usable.</p>
<ul>
    <li class="project-completion-needs-polishing"><a href="ancillary/crystallise/">Crystallise</a>, a file archival app: <span>needs polishing</span></li>
    <li class="project-completion-mostly-complete"><a href="ancillary/warcdealer/">Warcdealer</a>, a Web archive uploader app: <span>mostly complete</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Work-in-progress ancillary projects</h2>
<p>These are secondary projects that are related to the development of the main project, and are not yet generally usable.</p>
