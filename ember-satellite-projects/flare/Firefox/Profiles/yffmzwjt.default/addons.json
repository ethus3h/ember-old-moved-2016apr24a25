It is intended to be a lightweight extension of the RSS capabilities already included in Firefox, not a completely new feed management system.\n\nInstalling the Feed Sidebar will add a new sidebar to Firefox that, when opened, will display the unread items from the feeds that you have bookmarked in Firefox. Clicking on an item will show a preview in the bottom of the sidebar, and double- or middle-clicking will open the item in the browser and remove it from the sidebar.\n\nYou can choose to have the sidebar continue displaying items you've already read. If you do, these items will appear grayed out. If all of the items in a feed have been read, the feed title will be grayed out as well.\n\nThe Feed Sidebar will continue to check for new items when the sidebar is closed and will notify you when new items are found. As of version 3.0, it also has offline support, so you can read all of your feeds even if you have no Internet connection.\n\nThe Feed Sidebar toolbar contains buttons to open all items in tabs, mark all items as read, change the number of days of items to show, stop the current feed update, force a feed update, change the update interval, and hide/show the search bar. In addition, the context (right-click) menu will allow you to mark individual items as read/unread, mark an entire feed as read, open the items from a single feed in tabs, unsubscribe from a feed, and open the Feed Sidebar options dialog.\n\nThe Feed Sidebar uses its own history to track read items, so you can clear your browser history without also clearing your feed history.\n\nNote: If you are using Sage or some other feed reader that can export its feeds in OPML format, you can import that OPML to use with Feed Sidebar by installing the OPML Support Firefox extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2625","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/131/131640.png?src=api&modified=1395544748","width":"630","height":"476","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/131/131640.png?src=api&modified=1395544748","thumbnailWidth":"199","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Feed Sidebar shows (by default) the unread items from your feeds."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/131/131642.png?src=api&modified=1395544748","width":"630","height":"476","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/131/131642.png?src=api&modified=1395544748","thumbnailWidth":"199","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"You can also choose to show items you've already read."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/131/131644.png?src=api&modified=1395544748","width":"630","height":"476","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/131/131644.png?src=api&modified=1395544748","thumbnailWidth":"199","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"You can filter your feeds with the search bar."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/131/131646.png?src=api&modified=1395544748","width":"630","height":"476","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/131/131646.png?src=api&modified=1395544748","thumbnailWidth":"199","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"You can unsubscribe from a feed or open the options dialog from the context menu."}],"homepageURL":"http://www.chrisfinke.com/addons/feedbar/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/feed-sidebar/?src=api","supportURL":"http://www.chrisfinke.com/addons/feedbar/","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":105,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/feed-sidebar/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":962858,"weeklyDownloads":251,"dailyUsers":7388,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/253008/feed_sidebar-8.0.4-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":136471,"updateDate":1396881296000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"uBlock0@raymondhill.net","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-32.png?modified=1442930574","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-64.png?modified=1442930574"},"type":"extension","name":"uBlock Origin","version":"1.3.6","creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/gorhill/?src=api"},"description":"Finally, an efficient blocker.

the status bar was replaced with the \"Add-on Bar\", an empty, but customizable, toolbar. While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it. The preferred way to contact me is to post in the official support topic on MozillaZine or create an issue on GitHub.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313365635","width":"700","height":"509","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313365635","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"S4E provides a handful of toolbar items replicating the functionality of the old status bar.

Stylish's companion website, userstyles.org, hosts tens of thousands of user styles made by other Stylish users that you can try.\n\nFor you technical types out there, think of it this way: Stylish and userstyles.org are to CSS as Greasemonkey and userscripts.org are to JavaScript.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/81/81992.png?src=api&modified=1352439540","width":"700","height":"360","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/81/81992.png?src=api&modified=1352439540","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"103","caption":"The Stylish manage pane in Firefox Add-ons dialog"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/81/81990.png?src=api&modified=1352439540","width":"700","height":"412","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/81/81990.png?src=api&modified=1352439540","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"118","caption":"Installing a style"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/81/81988.png?src=api&modified=1352439541","width":"700","height":"379","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/81/81988.png?src=api&modified=1352439541","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"108","caption":"Editing a style"}],"homepageURL":"http://userstyles.org/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=api","supportURL":"http://userstyles.org/help/stylish_firefox","contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/stylish/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$5.00","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":763,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/stylish/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":28936673,"weeklyDownloads":24623,"dailyUsers":653834,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/301052/stylish-2.0.2-fx+an+sm+tb.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":202627,"updateDate":1425063278000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"ClassicThemeRestorer@ArisT2Noia4dev","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/472/472577-32.png?modified=1447754567","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/472/472577-64.png?modified=1447754567"},"type":"extension","name":"Classic Theme Restorer","version":"1.4.3","creator":{"name":"Aris","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/aris-t2/?src=api"},"description":"Squared tabs, appmenu, add-on bar, small button view and many more 'old' features for Firefox 29+ (Windows / MacOSX / Linux).\n\nAll builds & changelogs on versions page!","fullDescription":"This add-on restores squared tabs, the application button with application menu (known from Firefox for Windows), the add-on bar, bookmarks/history menu/sidebar buttons and other buttons. It moves star & feed buttons into location bar, adds status bar element to the ui and allows many items to be movable. All features are fully optional. Some buttons have to be moved to toolbars manually using browsers 'customizing' mode.\n\nMain features (on options window)\n\n    Tab appearance: squared classic tabs\n    Tab appearance: curved tabs (all colored and visible)\n    Tabs not on top + [tabsontop=\"false/true\"] attribute\n    Tabs height settings\n    Tabs min/max-width settings\n    Tab title in Firefox titlebar\n    Tab loading animations\n    Tab close on all tabs, active tab, toolbars start/end\n    Custom 'new tab' page url (Firefox 41+)\n    Double click on tabs toolbar opens a 'new' tab [Windows only]\n    Hide tabs toolbar with one visible tab\n    Custom colors for tab backgrounds, text and text shadow\n    Custom tab separators\n    Application button on toolbars (+ icon variations)\n    Application button on titlebar [Windows only]\n    Custom title for application button on titlebar [Windows only]\n    Predefined/custom application button colors\n    Small navigation toolbar buttons\n    Movable back-forward buttons\n    Alternative appearance for about:preferences page\n    Open 'about:preferences' page in a window (simulates preference window)\n    Alternative about:add-ons (add-ons manager) appearance (Firefox 40+)\n    Show add-ons version number in add-ons manager (Firefox 40+)\n    Activity indicator (throbber) on toolbars\n    Bookmarks-star button in location bar\n    Rss-Feed button in location bar\n    Old Search ui for Firefox 43+\n    Movable status-bar panel\n    Additional location bar\n    Combine stop & reload buttons\n    Hide location bars stop, reload & go buttons\n    Hide private browsing mask\n    Findbar on top or bottom\n    'Icons & Text' and 'Text only' modes\n    Add [iconsize=\"large\"]/[iconsize=\"small\"] attributes to #nav-bar node\n    Compact panel menus (bookmarks, history...)\n    Green/blue site identity button for verified websites and secure connections\n    Replace context menu icons with labels (Back, Forward...)\n    Add up to 20 additional toolbars to to top browsers area\n    Restore empty favicon on tabs\n    Replace generic favicon (empty and dotted) with sheet favicon\n    Favicon in locations bars identity box (location bars left)\n    Different padlock icons\n    AeroBlue toolbar colors for Windows 8/XP/Classic, Linux, MacOSX\n    Hide navigation toolbar\n    Inverted (white) toolbar button icons\n    Toolbar settings to alter colors, sizes, borders\n    Disable some ui animations\n    Force some toolbars to appear in fullscreen mode\n    Remove title/menu/tabs toolbars background for Windows 10\n    Disable browsers Loop (chat), Reader & Pocket features\n    ...and more\n\n\nFeatures (not on options window)\n\n    about:preferences keeps last selected category/tab\n    Enable/disable 'Add-on Bar' (toolbar context menu)\n    Toggle 'Add-on Bar' using 'Ctrl + /' btw.

On MacOSX tabs also get a 'reversed appearance'.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication button on [Firefox] titlebar [Windows only]\nThe titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left like on Firefox since version 4.0. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication button on toolbars\nOn toolbars the button appears like a default toolbar button.\n\nApplication button colours\nOn titlebar and tabs toolbar the application button can be orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray in normal browsing mode and purple in private browsing mode like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. The 'splitmenu' will not be restored and the appmenu popup/submenus also miss some non-replicable menuitems.\n\nSmall navigation toolbar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate old 'small icon view'.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding navigation toolbar might be interesting after content got moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at the bottom of the window. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar) or using 'Ctrl + /' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd + /' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nA toolbar between navigation toolbar and bookmarks toolbar. It can be enabled/disabled using toolbars context menu (right-click on a toolbar).\n\nIcons + text / text only mode\nSimulates old icons + text / text modes where text was displayed below toolbar buttons or button icons got hidden.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nA default 'menu button' which opens the 'classic' bookmarks menu. Positioned on bookmarks toolbar the button also displays its label.\n\nBookmarks and history sidebar buttons\nButtons which toggle bookmarks and history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTR adds duplicates of these buttons to the customization palette.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace reload button AFTER stop button and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hovering the option on preference window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces, flexible spaces and separators\nThese toolbar items appear in customizing mode and can be moved to toolbars like on previous Firefox versions.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8(.1) & 10 & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9/10.10. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nInfo, known 'issues', 'glitches', problems\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox resolves the problem. This glitch is caused by Microsoft Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Entering and leaving customizing mode 'disables' right-click menu items for bookmarks inside bookmarks menu button. A restart resolves this issue.\n4) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using Firefox 28 colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n5) It is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab and Shareaholic before installing Firefox 29 or newer, because both add-ons break Firefox ui in Fx29+. Using Foxtab and/or Shareaholic with CTR causes even more errors, because CTR allows to move/remove more items than the default Firefox does.\nIf one of these add-ons has corrupted the ui, the add-ons manager has to be accessed via menubar (right-click on a toolbar -> select menubar, Tools -> add-ons) and Shareaholic and Foxtab have to be uninstalled and CTR has to be disabled. After a browser restart, CTR can be enabled again. After another restart \"restore defaults\" in customizing mode has to be hit once.\n\n##############################################\n\nIt is recommended to switch to a clean new profile or at least to trigger \"Restore Defaults\" in customizing mode to avoid UI issues after upgrading from Firefox 28 (and older) to Firefox 29 (and newer). Profile Switcher can help too.\n\n##############################################\n\nAVAST AV software,\"Browser Cleanup\" and disappearing Firefox add-ons\nIf Avasts \"Browser Cleanup\" still accidentally removes Firefox add-ons consider removing or disabling \"Browser Cleanup\" feature.\n\n##############################################\n\ngHacks.net article (10 Reasons why you may want to

entries in the password manager.","fullDescription":"This extension allows you to enter data into the Password Manager database instead of relying on Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, etc., to do it, as well as making changes to existing entries. For web forms, the typical usage is as follows:\n\n    Navigate to the page containing the login form.\n    Right-click on one of its fields and select from among \"Save login info\" (to create a new entry), \"Edit login info\", and \"Delete login info\".\n    If another popup appears, select the username for the entry you want to operate on.\n    If adding a new entry, everything except the username and password should be filled in automatically. Fill in anything that is missing or incorrect.\n    If adding or editing an entry, reload the page or return later. If the form doesn't get autofilled, most likely the page is asking the browser not to autofill it by declaring autocomplete=\"off\". Try clicking twice on the username field and selecting from the dropdown list. There is a video demonstrating this workaround.\n\nThis add-on also adds commands to the Password Manager window, which it makes accessible through Tools > Saved Passwords as well as a toolbar button.\n\nA short tutorial video is available.\n\nIf you need support, please go to the support web site I have listed or email me (link on the details page, next to this description).

Design your browser with your favorite font.","fullDescription":"Theme Font & Size Changer is a simple browser tool that lets you change the font size and font family of Firefox and several other Mozilla products. It is especially valuable tool for visually impaired people and wide screen users.\n\nDifferent from add-ons that enlarge and reduce text on web pages, Theme Font & Size Changer changes the font size and font family in all windows, menus, toolbars, etc within Firefox itself. All font size, font family, and other changes are applied instantly and they are saved permanently and through sessions. You may assign your favorite font into your browser interface and change its size as you wish.\n\nIt was initially created to be an accessibility aid for persons with visual impairments and for those without perfect eyesight, but it's also useful for Firefox users with high resolution settings and wide screens.\n\nWhile Theme Font & Size Changer was written to be used with Firefox default theme, it does work with other non-default themes, but you may come across issues where some elements within Firefox retain the (non-default) font size setting that the theme developer chose for their theme.\n\nThere are two places that you can manage the global font size and font family of Firefox via Theme Font & Size Changer:\n\n    Toolbar Button: Click on the Theme Font & Size Changer button to open up Theme Font & Size Changer settings panel.\n    Tools Option: Choose Tools menu from Firefox Menu Bar and click on the Theme Font & Size Changer option. It will open up Theme Font & Size Changer settings panel. \n\n\nTheme Font & Size Changer Settings\n\n    Zoom:\n    This is a global zoom feature that enlarges/zooms both Firefox itself (including buttons and icons), and web page content simultaneously.\n    The default Firefox full page zoom controls can still be used independently.\n    --------------------------------\n    Font:\n    Changes the font family used for Firefox itself (not web pages).\n    The fonts installed on your system are displayed and can be used.\n    No fonts are installed by Them Font & Size Changer\n    --------------------------------\n    Size:\n    Changes the font size used for Firefox itself (not web pages).\n    --------------------------------\n    Style:\n    Changes the font style for Firefox to Italic.\n    --------------------------------\n    Weight:\n    Changes the font weight for Firefox to Bold.\n    --------------------------------\n    Color:\n    Changes the font color for Firefox.\n    --------------------------------\n    Background Color:\n    Changes the background color of the top toolbars.\n    --------------------------------\n    Context Menu:\n    Applies Background Color selection to context menus.\n\n\nTheme Font & Size Changer also allows you to change the global font size and font family for the user interface in Thunderbird and SeaMonkey.\n\nFIREFOX USERS:\n\n    The Theme Font & Size Changer button is added to the right side of the Navigation Toolbar by default. You can move it to any toolbar that you wish including the Status Bar by right clicking on a toolbar, selecting Customize, and dragging the icon to the toolbar of your choice. \n\n\nTHUNDERBIRD USERS:\n\n    Statusbar Bar Button: Click on the Theme Font & Size Changer button inside your Thunderbird status-bar.\n    Tools Option: Choose Tools menu from Thunderbird Menu Bar and click on the Theme Font & Size Changer option. It will open up Theme Font & Size Changer settings panel. \n\n\nSEAMONKEY USERS:\n\n    Statusbar Bar Button: Click on the Theme Font & Size Changer button inside your Thunderbird status-bar.\n    Toolbar Button: It is optional so it is not visible as default. If you want to place a Toolbar Button, right click on a toolbar button like Home Button, then choose Customize option. A window will pop up. Find the Theme Font & Size Changer button, then click and drag the Theme Font & Size Changer button in the toolbar of your choice and drop the button. Clicking on this Theme Font & Size Changer button will open up Theme Font & Size Changer settings panel. \n\n\nPlease do not send your support or help questions as review.\nYou may send your your support or help questions to:\nhttp://barisderin.com/?p=287\n\nIf you enjoy Theme Font & Size Changer, please feel free to leave a comment or rating, and share it with your friends and family.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ken Saunders for the priceless contributions and testing efforts.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nMore add-ons by Baris Derin","developerComments":"    Please do not send your support or help questions as review.
