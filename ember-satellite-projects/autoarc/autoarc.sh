	Safemv each file to its sha256
	Maintain a folder with all the sha256s that have been uled
	Any new ones, upload them
	and add them to that folder
	(as a sha256 containing the IA URL)
	Then pax.xz the folder of sha256s containg the IA url, and the folder of ln -ses
	and upload that.
	So, that file with the IA URLs by sha256 and the ln -ses are all that's needed to clone the repo
	I think that's pretty cool!
	When cloning, it'll 1) dl the pax.xz, 2) extract it, 3) donwnload any missing sha256s with the contents
	In the upload and download process, gpg the files.
	And pax.xz them
	in the other order
	1st step: If there aren't the necessary folder,s create them
	For the encryption, use a config file
	with the passphrase
	And that should be all that's needed to make this app work!
	I't'll need only the amuont of free disk space as the biggest file
	unlike Patche, which I'm using now, and needs 3x the free disk space of the whole repository
